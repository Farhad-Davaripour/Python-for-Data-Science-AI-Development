in this video we will cover polynomial regression and pipelines 

what do we do when a linear model is not the best fit for our data let's look into another type of regression model the polynomial regression we transform our data into a polynomial then use linear regression to fit the parameters that we will discuss pipelines pipelines are way to simplify your code 

polynomial regression is a special case of the general linear regression this method is beneficial for describing curvilinear relationships what is a curvilinear relationship it's what you get by squaring or setting higher order terms of the predictor variables in the model transforming the data the model can be quadratic which means the predictor variable in the model is squared we use a bracket to indicated as an exponent this is the second order polynomial regression with a figure representing the function 

the model can be cubic which means the predictor variable is cute this is the third order polynomial regression we see by examining the figure that the function has more variation 

there also exists higher order polynomial regressions when a good fit hasn't been achieved by second or third order we can see in figures how much the graphs change when we change the order of the polynomial regression the degree of the regression makes a big difference and can result in a better fit if you pick the right value in all cases the relationship between the variable in the parameter is always linear 

let's look at an example from our data we generate a polynomial regression model 

in python we do this by using the poly fit function in this example we develop a third order polynomial regression model base we can print out the model symbolic form for the model is given by the following expression 

negative one point five five seven X. one cute plus two hundred four point eight X. one squared plus eight thousand nine hundred sixty five X. one plus one point three seven times ten to the power of five we can also have multi dimensional polynomial linear regression the expression can get complicated here are just some of the terms for two dimensional second order polynomial none pies poly fit function cannot perform this type of regression we use the preprocessing librarian scikit learn to create a polynomial feature object the constructor takes the degree of the polynomial as a parameter then we transform the features into a polynomial feature with the fit underscore transform method let's do a more intuitive example 

consider the feature shown here applying the method we transform the data we now have a new set of features that are transformed version of our original features as that I mention of the data gets larger we may want to normalize multiple features as scikit learn instead we can use the preprocessing module to simplify many tasks for example we can standardize each feature simultaneously we import standard scaler we train the object fit the scale object then transform the data into a new data frame on a rate X. underscore scale there are more normalization methods available in the pre processing library as well as other transformations we can simplify our code by using a pipeline library there are many steps to getting a prediction for example normalization polynomial transform and linear regression we simplify the process using a pipeline 

pipeline sequentially perform a series of transformations the last step carries out a prediction first we import all the modules we need then we import the library pipeline we create a list of topples the first element in the topple contains the name of the estimator model the second element contains model constructor we input the list in the pipeline constructor we now have a pipeline object we can train the pipeline by applying the train method to the pipeline object we can also produce a prediction as well 

the method normalizes the data performs a polynomial transform then outputs a prediction
